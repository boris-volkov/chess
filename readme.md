# Chess control visualizer

To understand a chess position, it is essential not to just see the pieces, but also to be able to imagine the squares that each piece controls. This visualizer is designed to aid in that. The squares controlled by white will be lit up blue, and the squares controlled by black will be lit up red. Squares controlled by both sides will get a mix of purple. 

### How to Use it:

- Click pieces to move them (no dragging yet)

- Hold `b` and click on a square to place a Bishop.
- Hold `n` and click on a square to place a Knight.
- etc.
- Hold with `Shift` to place black pieces. 

- Press `Escape` to clear the board.
- Press `Ctrl` to hide the pieces (and only see the squares controlled)
